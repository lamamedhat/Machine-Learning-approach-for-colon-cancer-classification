# Machine-Learning-approach-for-colon-cancer-classification
This repository contains code that performs various data analysis and Machine learning tasks. Generate a correlation matrix between features, filter the correlated columns based on a specified threshold, determine the best classifier using the Lazypredict Algorithm. Perform hyperparameter tuning using K-Fold and nested K-Fold cross-validation.
